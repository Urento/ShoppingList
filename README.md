This Project is to mostly learn Go and React with Tailwind

# TODO

- Replace all queries with react query
- Display toasts when doing actions (e.g. deleting an item or a notification)
- Send Notifications on Username/Password/Email Change
- Add CSRF Token to every request
- Remove Auth Check on every page load and just use the api response as an indicator if the user is actually authenticated
